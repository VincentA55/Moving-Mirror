# Moving-Mirror

This project uses an Arduino to control two stepper motors with an analog joystick. The motors move based on joystick input, allowing precise control over the position within a defined range. The joystick button toggles an automatic movement mode where the motors move incrementally every 5 minutes, reaching the limits of their range before returning to the home position. 

Hardware Components:
*	Arduino (Elgoo Uno R3)
*	2 Stepper motors (w/ A4988 drivers)
*	1 Analog Joystic (w/ button)
